## Goals

1. Fall into a routine ‚úÖ
2. Punjabi Revise ‚úÖ
3. NextJS eCommerce ‚úÖ
4. Neetcode 35 questions ‚ùå
5. Top 20 puzzles ‚ùå

### End of week:

I would say falling into a routine is still in progress. I just need to keep in mind to not sleep in the afternoon, and to not open youtube shorts!

Revising punjabi is going good. Just need to regularly read some punjabi sentences to be able to become fluent in reading punjabi.

I did complete the nextJS tutorial, so that is good, but there are still many aspects of nextJS I am not knowledgeable about.
Apart from that I also started exploring react native, so that went well.

4. and 5. I know that these should be the top priority after nextJS commerce but I was still not able to complete these goals.

I am thinking for the next week, I will complete all eCommerce app and website stuff and along with that get up to date on the cohort that I have decided to complete
but still have many topics pending.

I also did not give myself enough time to solve all leetcode daily problems and for the last 2 day just submitted the solution after understanding it. Will not follow this
bad practice going forward in the next week.

## Notable events happening
