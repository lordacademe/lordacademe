Today was the first day of the year. Started good enough.
After hitting chest and triceps in the gym, I installed Duolingo and started Spanish lessons.

Today I learned the words

- El Hombre: The man
- El nino: The boy
- La nina: The girl
- La Mujer: The woman
- El/La: The
- Yo: I
- Soy: I am
- Una - A/one
- Un - a
- Yo soy un nino: I am a boy
- Una nina: A girl (Una used with female?)

After that I also wrote punjabi letters, I am not sure whether I should spend time on punjabi along with spanish.
Also completed today's daily problem. It was easy sorting one.
Doing that I continued watching a tutorial on creating an eCommerce store on nextJS.
Then I slept in the afternoon 🙃

Afterwards, once again continued the tutorial and ended at 2:39:00 hours. It is around 11 hours, so a long way to go.
I also stretched my body and did some pushups in the evening.
Then I completed the first 3 neetcode problems and after drinking a very bad milk shake, that I made, went to sleep afterwards.

Pending Items:

- Puzzles, 
- Neetcode 2 questions
