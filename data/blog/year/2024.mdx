summary: 'Goals and plans for the year 2024'
---

This is my year to just be consistent. On introspection, I have seen that the only problem in my life is my lack of consistency.
If I take care of that, my life will sort itself out and all my problems will wink out of existence.

For the year 2024, I have defined achievable goals without overestimating myself.

# Changes made

1. Removed stretching from routine in evening

- Reason being, I will be in the library and would not be in my room for stretching. I was forced to take this step because I go to sleep after lunch which messes my routine.
