I am a lazy weak-willed individual making this blog to stop being a lazy weak-willed individual. I have not achieved or done anything noteworthy in my life, and the way I am living my life I don't think I ever will. This blog is a way for me to change the status quo and for once being consistent and dedicated in life.

[Link to my google sheets where I am marking everything](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSsY2tg08NbkrMzSIBCvbwLLR-K8tiM937XptbL5ChrXpimW5olO4NF6IQImZDzHDVGj-esSk9E6edX/pubhtml)

Also, just recently I visited a book shop and one thing I noticed is that everything sells. Given enough advertising and enough bait, people are willing
to buy anything and everything. I am hoping to turn this blog into a sort of journey from failure to success, so that my story becomes the so-called 'inspiration' that these other books are trying to give but actually are just lack lustre books each having almost similar content.

Or it could be that, all the books are similar because they are right, it's just that people like me are just not able to get that motivation or drive reading them. So I am just writing down my journey of hard work and consistency to keep my self accountable, improve my writing skills and hopefully, gain money from it?

Yeah, so this is all about the inception of this blog.
